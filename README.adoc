== Running it locally

. Fist you will need to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[install Ruby^]
+
NOTE: Use `Ruby 2.1` or superior
. Install `Bundler` gem:
+ 
----
gem install bundler
----
+
TIP: You can skip this step if you want to install gems individually, see https://github.com/rmpestano/site/blob/master/Gemfile.xml[required gems here]
. Clone the project:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/rmpestano/site rsjug-site
cd rsjug-site
----
. Run 
+
----
bundle install
----
+
NOTE: It will install gems declared in `Gemfile`. You can skip this step if gems are already installed
+
IMPORTANT: If you receive the error `can't find header files for ruby at /usr/share/include/ruby.h` you need to install ruby development kit in your operating system:
+
----
//fedora
sudo dnf install -y gcc ruby-devel rubygems libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel
//ubuntu
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev 
//or
sudo apt-get install ruby2.0-dev
//or
sudo apt-get install ruby2.2-dev
----
+
IMPORTANT: if you get `ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.`, you need to install native extensions:
+
----
//ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
//or
sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
//fedora
sudo dnf install rpm-build
----
+
NOTE: output should be:
+
----
Bundle complete! 7 Gemfile dependencies, 27 gems now installed.
Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
----
. Then run Jekyll 
+
----
jekyll serve
----
. And finally access http://localhost:4000/site/


TIP: Every file change is automatically published locally by Jekyll.

<1> Global settings variables
<2> Navigation menu bar labels and navigation urls.
<3> Page includes of html fragments
<4> Disqus integration
<5> Layout of posts rendered in initial page (mainly a excerpt of the post with a link to read the full post)
<6> Post detail layout
<7> Main site layout (/site)
<8> Inner pages layout like posts, menus and internal pages
<9> Every page (except posts) that have an url, eg: `/sobre`, `/busca` etc...
<10> Site posts
<11> Generated site after `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build`
<12> Build and deploy rake task (executed by travisci after git push)
<13> Global Jekyll configuration like serving settings, plugins, includes/excludes etc...

== Publishing

Every git push triggers `travisci` which will run the `deploy` Rake task (see RakeFile) which will deploy the site to github pages.

NOTE: Travis and the rake task is only needed because `jekyll-asciidoctor` gem is not installed in github pages, https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc-quickstart#github-pages-and-asciidoc[see details here^].  


== Work done

. Forked this https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-io.github.io[Jekyll with bootstrap theme^];
. Added https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Asciidoc integration^];
. Played a bit with webfonts;
. Added `tags` page;
. Added `client side search` using http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/[lunr.js^];
. Added `archive` to list pages by year/month;
. http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/2014/06/29/adding-disqus-to-your-jekyll-powered-github-pages/[Disqus integration^]
. Played a bit with performance analysis sites like google-speed-test, webpagetest.org and pingdom.
